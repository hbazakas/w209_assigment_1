      In April I began using <a href="https://www.strava.com/dashboard">Strava </a> to track my exercise. The above chart details the different exercises I have logged.
      I have logged a variety of different kinds of exercises, and have gone different distances every time I ride/run/hike/walk.
      This is reflected in the colors of the bars and their lengths. This chart helps visualize what I have been up
      to since I began recording my exercises. Some of the key observations are that I ride my bike more frequently than
      I do any other type of exercise and I rarely go on runs (only one included in this dataset).

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>What</td>
          <td>
            I have nominal categorical data about what type of exercise I logged, as well as ratio numerical data
            about how long each ride was and how much elevation gain it included. These datapoints are tied to interval date
            data, which tells when each exercise was completed. These different datapoints about each instance of exercise
            help understand what patterns I've been falling into.
          </td>

        <tr>
          <td>Why</td>
          <td>
            I want to display the exercises I have done so far this year in a way that is easy to understand.
            I hope that viewers will quickly be able to tell what type of exercise I have been doing and how far I've gone.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>How</td>
          <td>
            For right now I am representing this with a bar chart showing distance. It also includes text, which describes the exercise.
            I think it could be possible to represent this mor succinctly. I also think I could visualize the time aspect better.
            My ideas to make this more engaging are to make it an interactive visual that changes when the viewer hovers.
            I would also like to think of a way to represent elevation visually rather than just numerically.

        <tr>
          <td>Insight 2</td>
          <td>Non-biking exercises tend to come in groups - there are two noticable clusters of hiking and walking.
            While one would not know this from looking at the graph, these are a result of my bike needing repairs.
         </td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
         <td>Insight 3</td>
         <td>My bike rides have not gotten significantly longer or shorter as the year has gone on. One might expect that
            I would ride longer distances as I get better at it, but this hasn't been the case. In fact, my longest rides were
            in the middle of the dataset.
